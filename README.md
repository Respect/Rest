Respect\Rest [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Respect/Rest.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Respect/Rest)
============

Thin controller for RESTful applications

Highlights:

 * Thin. Does not try to change how PHP works.
 * Lightweight. It uses few, small classes.
 * Maintainable. You can migrate from the microframework style to the class-controller style.
 * RESTful. The right way to create web apps.

Installation
------------

Please use PEAR. More instructions on the [Respect PEAR channel](http://respect.li/pear)

Feature Guide
=============

Configuration
-------------

    <?php

    use Respect\Rest\Router;

    $r3 = new Router;

Simple Routing
--------------

    $r3->get('/', function() {
        return 'Hello World';
    });

 1. *get* is the equivalent of the HTTP GET method. You can use post, put, delete
    or any other. You can even use custom methods if you want.
 2. *return* sends the output string to the dispatcher
 3. The route is automatically dispatched. You can set `$r3->autoDispatched = false`
    if you want.

Parameters
----------

    $r3->get('/users/*', function($screen_name) {
        return "Hello {$screen_name}";
    });

 1. Parameters are defined by a `/*` on the route path and passed to the
    callback function in the same order as they appear

Multiple Parameters
-------------------

    $r3->get('/users/*/lists/*', function($user, $list) {
        return "List {$list} from user {$user}";
    });

Optional Parameters
-------------------

    $r3->get('/posts/*/*/*', function($year,$month=null,$day=null) {
        //list posts
    });

 1. This will match /posts/2010/10/10, /posts/2011/01 and /posts/2010
 2. Optional parameters are allowed only on the end of the route path. This
    does not allow optional parameters: `/posts/*/*/*/comments/*`

Catch-all Parameters
--------------------

    $r3->get('/users/*/documents/**', function($user, $documentPath) {
        return readfile(PATH_STORAGE.$documentPath);
    });

 1. The above sample will match `/users/alganet/documents/foo/bar/baz/anything`.
    Callback $user parameter will receive alganet and $documentPath will
    receive an array filled with [foo,bar,baz,anything].
 2. Catch-all parameters are defined by a double asterisk \*\*.
 3. Catch-all parameters must appear only on the end of the path. Double
    asterisks in any other position will be converted to single asterisks.

Matching any HTTP Method
------------------------

    $r3->any('/users/*', function($userName) {
        //do anything
    });

 1. Any HTTP method will match this same route.
 2. You can figure out the method using the standard PHP `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']`

Bind Controller Classes
-----------------------

    use Respect\Rest\Routable;

    class MyArticle implements Routable {
        public function get($id) { }
        public function delete($id) { }
        public function put($id) { }
    }

    $r3->any('/article/*', 'MyArticle');

  1. The above will bind the class methods to the HTTP methods using the same
     path.
  2. Parameters will be sent to the class methods just like the callbacks on
     the other samples.
  3. Controllers are lazy loaded and persistent. The *MyArticle* class will
     be instantiated only when a route matches one of his methods, and this
     instance will be reused on other requests (redirects, etc).
  4. Classes must implement the interface Respect\Rest\Routable;

Controller Classes Constructors
-------------------------------

    $r3->any('/images/*', 'ImageController', array($myImageHandler, $myDb));

  1. This will pass `$myImageHandler` and `$myDb` as parameters for the
     *ImageController* class.

Direct Instances
----------------

    $r3->any('/downloads/*', $myDownloadManager);

  1. Sample above will assign the existent `$myDownloadManager` as a controller.
  2. This instance is also reused by Respect\Rest

Bind Controller Factories
----------------

    $r3->any('/downloads/*', 'MyControllerClass', array('Factory', 'getController'));

  1. Sample above will use the MyController class returned by Factory::getController
  2. This instance is also reused by Respect\Rest

Route Conditions
----------------

    $r3->get('/documents/*', function($documentId) {
        //do something
    })->when(function($documentId) {
        return is_numeric($documentId) && $documentId > 0;
    });

  1. This will match the route only if the callback on *when* is matched.
  2. The `$documentId` param must have the same name in the action and the
     condition (but does not need to appear in the same order)
  3. You can specify more than one parameter per condition callback.
  4. You can specify more than one callback: `when($cb1)->when($cb2)->when($etc)`
  5. Conditions will also sync with parameters on binded classes and instances
     methods

Route Proxies (Before)
----------------------

    $r3->get('/artists/*/albums/*', function($artistName, $albumName) {
        //do something
    })->by(function($albumName) {
        $myLogger->logAlbumVisit($albumName);
    });

  1. This will execute the callback defined on *by* before the route action.
  2. Parameters are also synced by name, not order, like `when`.
  3. You can specify more than one parameter per proxy callback.
  4. You can specify more than one proxy: `by($cb1)->by($cb2)->by($etc)`
  5. A `return false` on a proxy will stop the execution of following proxies
     and the route action.
  6. Proxies will also sync with parameters on binded classes and instances
     methods

Route Proxies (After)
----------------------

    $r3->get('/artists/*/albums/*', function($artistName, $albumName) {
        //do something
    })->through(function() {
        //do something nice
    });

  1. `by` proxies will be executed before the route action, `through proxies`
     will be executed after.
  2. You don't need to use them both at the same time.
  3. `through` can also receive parameters by name

Running inside a folder
-----------------------

To run Respect\Rest inside some folder (eg. http://localhost/my/folder), pass
that folder to the Router constructor:

    $r3 = new Router('/my/folder');

You can also use it without .htaccess/rewrite support:

    $r3 = new Router('/my/folder/index.php');

Content Negotiation
-------------------

Respect currently supports the four distinct types of conneg: Mimetype,
Encoding, Language and Charset. Usage sample:

    $r3->get('/about', function() {
        return array('v' => 2.0);
    })->acceptLanguage(array(
        'en' => function($data) { return array("Version" => $data['v']); },
        'pt' => function($data) { return array("VersÃ£o"  => $data['v']); }
    ))->accept(array(
        'text/html' => function($data) {
            list($k,$v)=each($data);
            return "<strong>$k</strong>: $v";
        },
        'application/json' => 'json_encode'
    ));

As in every routine, conneg routines are executed in the same order that
you appended them to the route.
